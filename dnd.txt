welcome to dragonlance shadow of the Dragon Queen [Music]
becklin the City sheriff in charge of Thon will keep was in the bar with her Squire Goose Junior and The Squire guy
obviously have some intense history somehow but I don't even know who he is so I headed back to the room to freshen
up before uncleisten's funeral I found Ollie was awake finally and stammering about some human poacher or Trapper or
something that huntses little animal friends back home I would guess he'd had a bad dream where not for the fact he's also bleeding from
the throat and mother's animal mask is practically glowing with transmutation magic now Corey asks Goose to switch
rooms with Ollie so that we don't have to put up with this for another night and he agrees at the cost of a favor to
be redeemed later of course Goose just can't do something nice for us without getting something for it Juni cleaned up
Ollie and we go to the funeral but that awful cow Cassandra from school is here too for some reason with two of her
guards staying close enough together to be able to swap that brain cell they're sharing despite her incredibly
disrespectful comments Goose makes a nice speech about Uncle Espin unfortunately hot head that he is he
doesn't think about the consequences of who she is or how she might be connected and start to fight with one of her guards and then of course little
desperate lap dog that he is Ollie jumps into the fight as well Conjuring some showy ursine spirit and again
demonstrating a lack of control over mother's natural abilities gifted to him with order restored from becklin the
funeral continued with Junior giving a nice speech just as father arrived on Juniper the horse
Sandra is clearly drunk and still Rowdy as I say my goodbyes to my dear uncle I'm sorry to say that I very nearly lost
control and did something I would have likely regretted later but thankfully she decided to wriggle
back to the Wormhole she crawled out of honestly who heckles at a funeral anyway after the funeral becklin gave us a
shield that belongs to ispin and requests that goose take his place in the reenactment of the battle of high
hill now I haven't seen Goose perform in some time but I'm highly skeptical that he'll
be able to live up to hispan's wonderfully dramatic and yet moving deaths each year but then again maybe we'll witness his
actual deaths given he's wearing a cursed ring that he doesn't even know the first thing about yes that's right the buffoon came clean that he stole the
ring from Cassandra's family the Gerbers and he can't take it off now Corey and I had to go for a walk to cool
down from that news unfortunately for us cow Sandra's Grudge for us may have deepened and she sent
one of her goons to quote be used to a pulp the hook it didn't take much to
outwit the [ __ ] with muscles where there should be brains and we escaped back to the safety of the pub where our
family were in various states of inebriation the next day by the time we're all awake the festival was in full swing Ollie
handed over a bag of Steel coins he'd found on the bodies of the men the other day and Juni took it upon herself to decide we needed an allowance and cannot
be trusted to Simply handle our own money like adults knowing our Sandra is around Corey does something I've never
seen of her before she actually asked for Goose's help and put on makeup and a blouse
I'm not used to seeing her look so different but she sort of pulls it off you know
anyway we're at the festival now Goose played some cards Ollie typical has always managed to find some beasts
to talk to and Juni did some archery I think well Corey and I acquired a magical chocolate coin a ducat of luck
height I've used it to win a pie eating contest
oh now I still feel deathly ill from that the prize money was worth it hopefully
good all right perfect and with this amazing recap wow what a recap geez that recap was long oh it's
like seven years [Laughter]
the worst dude imagine imagine uh I wanted to recap to be the next one
to be twice as long give me a 12 minute recap you guys make the recap for longer than the
episode and I think it will be in the right place a four hour recap that's the plus side about playing an idiot you just say like
three sentences because that's all he can remember
listen to us yes
hi dredge hello who are you oh oh hi uh my my intro got my intro got melded into
AJ's because I'm in the studio ah um hi I'm Dred Dre GM if you want to see
what I'm doing I run hey I wanted I run a twitch Channel and a YouTube channel dredgeium and
I just have a lot of fun and a professional game Monster and voice actor and if you want to check out my stuff uh just type it into Google and
you'll find me um but yeah movie Nights is currently running we are watching all the d d movies together uh with Rob over there
we go to call Cthulhu game coming up really soon which is super cool um and I think that might be it for now
I've got some other stuff in the works you'll find out Google it okay it's on the line yeah you've done it yeah I've
done it perfect thank you I forgot it it'll go it all got mixed into one
so at the end of last week's episode you guys were enjoying the festival the
musics the sights The Sounds the tastes for some of you uh more than others and
as you were finishing up with your archery contest and mingling with the beasts and hanging out and doing cool
things the voice of becklin called out to let everybody know
and in fact a separate voice that you guys haven't quite heard yet but you recognize the mayor of the town mayor
Raven her voice carrying across from the central uh Central area of the Town saying that the Battle of high hill is
set to start in about an hour and that the walk to the grounds where this
reenactment this to take place is about 30 minutes north of town and with this see the villagers sort of
start packing up uh Yao May back in the brass grab is telling everybody all
right everybody out I need to stop preparing for the feast after we win yet again against the historian forces come
on out out and people are starting to gather in the central part of town to get ready to go
for the walk to um the battlefield now a lot of you know because this isn't the
first tier that you're here that the Battle of high hill is a reenactment essentially of a war or a
battle that happened hundreds of hundreds of years ago it is the story of the foundation of the town where a small
local militia led by Lord Vogler who was the founder of the Town stood against an
army of Ishtar from the East and proved to be successful on that day and it was
Camaro and has was commemorated and continues to be commemorated by the reenactment every year it's a big honor
to be a part of it and um Goose you were specifically invited to be part of it so the door is open to
all of you if you wish to participate in some manner so knowing that people are heading out and the booths are slowly Closing one by
one is there anything else you guys want to do the fishing contest has come to a close you guys missed out sadly is there
anything else you guys wanted to do before you fall to town or maybe some of you didn't want to go let's throw
definitely throw up after collecting his winnings she still
feels just super nauseous nauseated and uh walks walks into an Alleyway or so
he's respectful enough to try and find an outhouse or a bathroom or a long drop but if he can't he will throw up in a
barrel in some uh some Alleyway yeah sure as you're walking by sure enough
there are plenty like enough barrels that are like partially open because people have been celebrating uh make a
person let's see what you find make a quick perception check
nice yeah you find that there's a a cast that's been open and people are like dipping their mugs to drink but luckily
instead of yakking up in there you find beside it a a small um bucket that's been used to like gut fish and yeah this
is the best place presumably to let loose delicious
see Goose just steps up next to you in the alley it's like you know they should they say never to do a reenacted battle
on an empty stomach but uh in this case I think maybe probably for
the best state nice you're like a mint
it's in my nose yeah it gets that way
[Music]
that's very convincing so as we all do Rob it's participatory
theater you see it's uh yeah experience it's an experience yeah
exactly it is the thing it is the thing where you like you've got nothing in your stomach anymore but he's still like dry riching like there's that the body's
like Hey we're still poisoned get get it all out and yeah everything nothing left
but the fumes all right big slaps on the back yeah as as they
were you know there's a kid that comes by Mom Mom I think he had a better too much berry juice
ew I didn't know elves could throw up I don't know sun berry juice
Lyndon are you all right [Music] no but it's worth it for the money I
hope I think so but um you're looking a little green
yeah could you uh could you help could you clean me up a little I feel like it
how much uh how much money did you make may I ask uh you may not I mean I'm not
going to tell you it wasn't a lot okay well then it was worth it then
okay um we need to get you to the reenactment
kill a hangover cure is this the same thing do you think a hangover cure would help what's going on here I don't know I
don't I don't think anything that you want me to consume drink eat it's not going to stay down I I just need to sit
it out I think alrighty I mean well if it is that
potatoes is all I would say just get some am I am I seeing things or is Junior being attacked by a wolf she'll
be right she'll be right she said that's happened before it's not busted down my door we saw is
that is that one of is that is that one of Ollie's wolves
yes yes that's calling the wildlife I love them we don't know these wolves
they're not they're not like the ones near the farms you just maybe we should get to know them he's a good boy a good
boy he smells bad no I think that's I think that's Linden
I just cast president on him what does it just might be disappear me yes
[Music] I don't look well at all
um sometimes I might have some like kind of uh just like essentially um chewing
leaf or you know like essentially Mint or something um that I might be able to oh I think I
actually um I have like some ginger root I can I can
quickly you know make a little I mean yes if you have something
yeah do I need to roll for them no no you're fine I got survival skills presumably you
have something to settle the stomach a little bit yeah just like a root
very much in the poison condition sadly the ginger that you pull up has like has
more that's grown on it you didn't notice till you handed it to him it doesn't help that goose is right behind Juniper eating a large bowl of porridge
[Laughter] where did you get that
I was just lying there okay well that's theft and disgusting it's free porridge is what it is
porridge so sloppy fairly sure like 60 okay why
don't Lyndon why don't you and I go for a bit of a walk and get some fresh air let's let's get towards the the
reenactment area the hill Goose can you know someone makes sure that goose gets
where he needs to be I think you just need to get far away from smells right now yeah yeah I can do that Juni I'll
help you get there Goose hey can I have some of that yeah have some alley

[Music] uh I'm not really a performer come on
J-Town I mean heavy money the most convincing death that and there are Judges and I'll be happy to
um allow Corey and Linden to judge and give us also their thoughts on the best death on the battlefield
[Music] come on
[Music] already so you're already assuring
are you sure you don't want to participate Corey it's it's a lot of fun and you know thank you
[Music] stay with Lyndon [Music] um London just holds holds his hand out

we're not children anymore I didn't say that you were
sorry so I'm gonna write down goose and Oleander and do I put you down as at
what side I'd put a dentist no uh J Bone are you on the militia of
the town or are you attacking with kajal zombies [Music]
I am part of the town's militia wonderful Jay Bone goose and Orient
wonderful excellent I'll see you there and um May you have may you have
wonderful deaths and uh wow that was a great dog Love Dogs uh and with this Shield my new dwarf friend you make
friends he's very talkative for some reason we're still getting picking up strays
you can't help it and with that the town begins their long 30-ish minute March which might take a
little bit longer for Linden in particular at this moment um and they head off in the direction of
hi ho is everybody going along is anybody staying behind
okay with just not part of participating
perfect passing through woods and Fields Wagner's parade of militia members and
reenactment Spectators finally reaches High Hill takes you about 30-35 minutes and this year there's a very special
occasion in that the mayor mayor Raven has asked a friend of the Town
um cudgel Iron smile to bring her actual military troops there
and those of you actually all of you would decipher this I don't need you guys to rule an insight
there have been rumors of strange sightings to the east from here you were
reminded of the three nights that you ran into along the roads who were in some kind of mission
and you gather that mayor Raven asked for cudgel's help and providing maybe a
little bit more oomph yes it's still padded weapons and and wooden swords and so on and so forth but just it wouldn't
hurt to get the militia a little bit more involved in pretend fighting so that if
who knows real fighting ever broke out there might be a little bit more experience amongst the groups
response to the show of it yeah uh the grassy slope is spotted with tree
it is spotted with trees and crumbled Stone Fence near the base several dozen soldiers and matching armor stand in
even formation and you recognize the these being as iron Smiles people the
contrast is striking between these mercenaries of the Ironclad regiment and vogler's militia with their mismatched
armor and crooked helmets but it does nothing to dampen the spirits of those assembled for the Kingfisher festival's
climactic reenactment and there's a bit of a climb that goes to the top of the hill at that moment
the mayor Kajol becklin all separate and go with the
townsfolk to go towards the seating area which overlooks the battle and she
points to the top of the hill where this massive tree called the victory tree which was planted after the war was won
or the battle was one stands atop overlooking the entirety of the battlefield where the militias Gathering
and they have The High Ground so she looks again one more time so Jay
Bone Oleander and um Goose you're going up there and Linden and cordless you're staying with
us yes let's go yes yes yeah staying here
perfect yeah could I get a reminder as to how long I was suffering the poison
condition was it an hour after about an the 30 minute walk we'll
do wonders for your Constitution um by the time you get there you'll have evacuated everything there might be a
make a con saving throw you want to roll above a 10. here we go uh that is a that was cooked
let's go again uh yeah it says 16. nice there's a moment you think that maybe your bowels would want to participate in
this Festival but you're able to hold back and you're you're okay you don't embarrass yourself or your sister
feel good but I feel better I'm not getting cramps anymore at least one of the people that's behind you is like
dude really I'm right behind you it's like come on man like
well I mean it's if you have a problem leave I mean
spots don't stink no it's stinks smells like rotten egg bro I don't I don't know what you're
eating something else you're not up bro you're just a random person
yet I'll eat most people want to sit down and related to us but you don't have to point it out I mean why did he
call us bro it's doesn't that upset you you're the one that's so obsessed with words
I don't get what this has got to do with Battlefield reenactment surely everything stunk like [ __ ] back then
[Music] well it still does apparently says the the person that was behind Linden and
just kind of moves on ahead yeah it's realism [ __ ] yeah [ __ ]
I hope you die horribly and that it sucks Linda Linden is sitting down just
beetroot Reds just head in hands just so embarrassed that everybody's having so much discussion about his unintended
flatulence from having food poisoning Linden's a lot of fun as much as he wants
have you ever used prestidization before to clear a fart I just I think I needed to ask that question but here we are
too much milk perfume-esque sense towards people and I
feel like this is similar it's just like nice um you know there's like fake air freshener smell nice and masking over
the top of the smell rather than clearing it it's like that when you go to a car the pine scent like and it just
it doesn't it's just mingling with it yeah it's like ah now this dumpster is inside
of a Pine Forest you know you would think that farts
wouldn't be so insulting to people nature a lot of creatures fought I've seen birds how much how many
percent of this stream is going to be dedicated to this fat 100 this is it this is where we started knuckle down
it's the BART episode this is it's really not yeah give it time give it time
I have to repeat on it much laughter and jostling the mayor cudgel and other
Spectators are walking to a nearby Vantage points to watch Linden and Corey along with them
you see that in that mix as you're walking and you're a little bit behind you see that Cassandra
is coming in from the other side to prepare herself to stand with the Watchers to observe because she lives in
town she's in town and she wants to watch the fight I'm not sure if that changes anything for you guys if she
accidentally gets killed by a Flying Arrow that's that was meant as a prop but was accidentally sharpened you know
it won't be the worst thing for an accidental flying Hammer that is thrown from I was gonna say interesting that
you immediately chose [Music] [Laughter]
I think uh I think Corey is going to no matter what Kari is doing from
henceforth uh have an eye trained on Cassandra yeah
all right so as she approaches towards the group of villagers that are going to
be watching the militia takes up its position atop high hill with Oleander with uh goose
and with juniper or j-bone sorry amongst that group and it's the same the same
Hill that salami troops held you know so long ago they face The Mercenaries of the Ironclad regiment at the base of the
Hill a raid is a force of istar arrayed as the force of estar once were although
the event is only a reenactment A tingle of excitement fills the field somewhere on the line a reenactor Hoots
and yells let's send those historian rats running now for the three of you that are part
of it there's the massive tree that stands that is climbable though it goes fairly High there's a broken down wall
that kind of surrounds the top of the hill there's the major group of uh you
know greens if you will militia members who are kind of staring they're nervous there's a bit of nervous energy they're
wearing these padded swords and Spears these blunted arrows but they're
grinning with excitement they're just like I'm gonna kill three of them I'm Gonna Knock Out for watch where did the
three of you want to sit so Goose where do you want to be in the in the makeup in the thick of things like where do you want to stand the only reason that goose
signed up for this and to be honest he would prefer to be on the mercenaries because he thinks the mercs are cooler uh that uh he wants to be in the front
of the charge like he wants to be the spearhead of the Vanguard he wants the experience of right like sprinting into
battle with a hammer in his hand he's not gonna probably get it in any other fashion okay so you're in the thick of things
you're up front people are looking to you well this guy looks like he really wants to get in there all right fine I'm
gonna follow him um let's go boys j-bones goose is
gassing everyone up he's like he's he's like overwhelming enthusiasm it's just like spilling out
nice how'd you do your hair like that is that part of like the the the thing
look I can teach you how to swing a hammer there's some things I can't teach but
all right all right I don't let's talk after the fight I'm I'm Keen I'm curious
battle faces on and he gives him a kiss on the cheek uh beside him you see
godswin's little brother is also in the mix up here getting ready to fight
um Garrett uh is is in the mix you don't see God's going anywhere by the way uh we haven't seen him since you woke up
this morning but there is Garrett hammer in hand looking to you doesn't say anything he's got his dirty blonde hair sort of like
overlooking his his eyes and he's looking excite a little bit nervous but he's breathing through it and he's
putting on a brain face but you can tell that he's actually kind of nervous about this whole thing Juniper uh Jay Bone I'm sorry where are
you standing oh damn um I think Juniper is very much not like an
actor and the whole time as she's been walking towards this thing to stay
a very aggressive Silence has settled over her as she's not participating in
the buzz she doesn't seem excited to be there um she kind of just wants to get this
over and done with so I think she's gonna pick like maybe a small little
kind of if there's a if there's any kind of branching off kind of group or she may
just kind of go go at solo and try and like sneak around and and
um do a sneak attack on the uh on the opposite side so there's like the broken old like stone wall that stands near the
tree and there's a couple of archers uh with their blunted arrows that are standing behind it using it as sort of cover and their planning of shooting
from behind there there's like three of them uh that's like the only branched off yeah that you see brilliant and I'm
an Archer so it's
j-bone but I could get more Revenue
I think maybe she will like give him us like almost like she's gonna turn around
and like look but then just kind of like forges on Ollie you watch us in the front yes it's
goose in the back end Juniper is sort of splitting off where do you want to stand uh Ollie's like an excited puppy is just
going up to people so hi I'm Ollie um that was American I'm sorry hi I'm Ollie
Ollie hi are you gonna die really good I think I'm gonna try and die the best that I can uh how are you going to die
how are you going to die hmm I'm thinking about maybe getting impaled or maybe I can do a a head Crush thing and
uh that's my brother over there that's that's Goose he's an Entertainer and a performer like me and oh that's J-Town
or j-bone or or Juni or how does people react to that yeah one of them besides
you is like well I I it's my second year and watch and he opens his jerket and you see that he has uh sausages that
he's stashed under it when I get gutted it's gonna look so good because I'm gonna put all these sausages to make a
look at somebody gut spilling yeah the prize money is mine for sure [Music]
hold on I'm gonna run over [Music] there
yeah they have props yeah well we have something better than that but that guy over there I'm gonna
point to this I should try it this sounds good we've got sausages has learned to make them look like these
Builders intestines it's gonna die better than us nah we got something better than that it's fine well what's that Talon
charisma we're gonna do well you think I have talent in Charisma you
uh getting there
[Laughter] all right game face on Big Buddy oh right
a moment later changed the game face on the cheek s
like you did everyone else it's just your kind of beside your
brother when suddenly you hear a trumpet blasts the signal to the start
of the battle you hear from down below the same creature the same individual
that you've seen before the half ogre towering for a star he yells and his
voice carries across the battlefield and you see this all these sort of dress soldiers and they look really good and
really threatening with their weapons start charging up the hill and all around you the wagler militia charges
down to meet them and within moments this does just a quick the entire theater in speech
before just just a quick
are you giving us the Braveheart speech is that what you said no the theater in speech oh nice yep
go ahead [Laughter]
and with this as the charging troops with um Juniper standing in the back all
the goose just kind of charging down towards I'm gonna ask all of you to
please make perception checks [Music]
[Music]
yeah everybody everybody
uh nine nine excellent anybody who rolled a 14 or above let me get this in
here you notice and you realize
as the charging troops are going up that the glint
of metal is definitely caught in the air
and it is just a second too late before the unexpected sound of metal clashing on Armor Rings across the battlefield
silencing laughter and melodramatic boasts a ribbon of red splashes over the grassy
Hill followed by shocked screams any pretense of reenactment shatters
High Hill is the site of a true battle once more within moments all around you
armed mercenaries attack unprepared villagers suddenly fighting for their
lives and I'm gonna ask all of you and we're gonna split this
into two groups to please roll initiative
holy crap oh my God it's totally oh geez Louise
yeah [ __ ] another 18.
okay yeah oh my God please don't die everyone
so 25 to 20. 20 to 15 18 Juniper
Christine Corey uh sorry that I was mine in that 11.
15 to 10. I love it uh goose is 10.
nine for Linden okay we're gonna generally abstract I don't think we necessarily need to have
like down to the exact size of things so just will be two groups will be group one which will be Juniper Ollie and
goose and group two will be Linden and Corey aside from everyone else so could I ask
um yeah for London because he was sick the whole time but with the walk on the way to this uh event have counted as a
short rest for curry sure yeah it's not strenuous it's actually kind of a nice walk and she's
uh holding on to thank you if you haven't already used it today I don't think you have you'll get your Arcane recovery so you'll get half of your
spell slots back yes because that will help I miss hopefully yeah I don't think I've actually used any of my spouses
today okay cool I don't know if you've done this this guy yourself or anything nope so we're gonna start
providing physical disguise yeah I'm wearing Greece's blouse hence the different colors today and uh the makeup
so in the thick of battle Juniper as you guys are charging down Juniper you're
you're further back than the rest of them but up in the front where you guys are charging the thicker things Ollie
and uh Goose so let's start with the three of you
four of the individuals you watch as immediately uh they're these mercenary
guards mounted on war horses that are not part of like the initial charging have come from the side looping around
the battlefield and it looked like at first they were watching have now
slammed it to the side but because you guys were a better initiative than they did you are ready for the three one of
them splits off three mercenary guards mounted on these war horses are barreling towards the side of your group
top of the round is a juniper you get sights of them they're about 60 feet away from you
okay well I would like to try and shoot one with my Longbow I assume I just like
ditch the rubber tips and just start drawing from my own quiver you got it
you would hope this is all part of it right I'm good
but I'm not that good um just like out of pure panic and fear
that this is all gonna go terribly wrong okay
uh that is a 14 14 misses as you take a shot the arrow
you watch the guard that's on the war horse bleed in hand snaps the arrow out of the air and
knocks It to the Ground uh these guys I fought before this is
not their first rodeo I don't think I have uh
yeah I I don't think I have any real bonus actions I can do apart from just a shout to
Goose Ollie I got you
stay back I I yeah I I know it and I'm like I got him
okay so with that as the war horse is trampling foreign I'm gonna skip Corey
for now because you guys are in a different group all the year next how far away is this guy's like 25 feet
away from you like he is literally goose is side by side with you Judy's 60
feedback behind shooting arrows from the top of that wall I'm gonna say I'm saying Goose we need to stick close
together okay but I can help
[Music] okay and as I do I'm going to take out
my Beartooth from before I'm going to rub my finger across its curve and I want to point down I'm going to say it's
been and as I say it's been um the bear is going to appear and bathe us all in green natural light and we all
get the effects of the bear Spirit and the bear spirit is going to give us uh I
can't remember yeah so temporary hit point is equal to five plus my druid level so we all get uh we will get seven
hit points yeah and we get advantage on strength checks and strength savings throws and this is for how many people
um it is each picture of my choice uh I can I can I'm pretty sure let me let me double check yeah
[Music]
it doesn't have a limit which is weird Okay that's fine it might not have so if you if you want to give people around me
as well thematically you give a few other people around us as well okay do you want to include the villagers that
are beside you yeah excellent oh yeah that is experts with us
and with this the Bear shows up and it lets out this Roar that invigorates the people around
you you see the shield of goose that he's carrying it spins shield and is it strapped to your back is it on your arm
where's that Shield Goose uh I think for this he would have it strapped to his arm perfect so strap you watch as the
vines that are growing on this green shield that has like the representation of leaves Vines and a tree on it
suddenly flares to life and there's this burst around it they're all looking to
you to this shield and You Hear The Echoes coming from all of them as one vote as if coming from one voice one
throat four has been and all of them feel invigorated what will you do after
this uh because you've run 30 feet up you've summoned the bear Spirit anything else yeah
so that was my bonus action yeah uh as my action I am going to
[Music] um I'm going to fling off a
bus level spell I sniff towards the closest grouped group of the the knights I'm gonna point
my hand out Gathering the moisture in the air it's going to pin prick in uh Pinnacles icicles in front I'm gonna
collect it together pull it together and just like throw it okay that sounds dangerous uh I think
you make an attack roll then there's like a saving throw in phone yeah so it's a 20 to hit one of the knights yeah
absolutely yes it hits yeah that's going to deal
uh three piercing damage nice yep and then a dexterity saving throw from each
creature within five feet of it so that includes the horse that he's riding then yeah oh
you know what yeah Carefree uh the night saves and the horse what's the DC
uh the DC will be my spell Save which is going to be a setting uh eleven the
horse the horse fails yeah okay so the horse is going to take
um it's gonna be 2d6 call damage yikes yeah
seven uh okay you watch as the horse Takes that damage and you watch his part of it
begins to freeze over it slows down and in doing so the horse the momentum of its trample charges reduced severely
okay as the area around you freezes a summoned there beside you changing the
entire complexity of the battlefield Goose you're up next uh uh goose is going to uh you see him
just being like behind behind me like he's just getting everyone because he he got unwell with the people around him
and they are fumbling a little bit I would imagine yes uh somewhat and so
he's like fine fine as he like Steps up to the front and you see him underneath the uh The Shield uh on his right arm
you see that ring on his finger and you see it burn hot and as it does what it's
it's not just burning from within it it's pulling all the heat out of the air and as it does the shield uh gets this
like icy rhyme of frost over the front as unknowingly he is casting a spell
um okay turning it like larger and more protective
um it is going to replace the the temp HP that uh that the bear provides but
he's gonna walk out like to the edge of where the bear like to the like the furthest out he can away from the the uh
the the riffraff of like innocent people you can try and draw he's gonna smack
the hammer against the Shield okay let me just change so we can see a
little bit better let's do this hopefully we can yeah okay that's not bad
um so you're down here I'm gonna have to add a few guys so you charge for it with the fire energy around you and yeah the
the two guards that are make up you know what make a performance check we'll call that like your taunt effect thick all
right it's a there's a nine there's a nine
let's see if any of them kind of fall for it let me do one one of them eights
what you just did and the other one is ignoring you so you definitely uh oh and the third guy sorry there's three of them
[Music] uh two of them really like seeing the fire they identify you as the greatest
threat and diverts their course away to come towards you so you've definitely drawn the ire of two of the mounted
guards is this kind of like yeah there's this lingering fire behind the shield but the shield itself is like covered in ice
nice uh so that's your action or bonus section that's gonna be my action and
I'm just fronting okay all right let me just breathe so I'll
add them in as I have time here on the battlefield with this the thunderous
you brace as two of them come directly trampling towards you Goose so let's do
uh what happens to you so this trampling charge comes at you um it's gonna try to hoof you plus six
to hit on the first one yep that's a nine easily you kind of get out
of the way and as it does so the Knight Will Will swoop down with his sword and try to take your head off as he's
sliding by he's not holding back these guys are out for blood um
plus three to hit for him nine both of them Miss uh you easily
kind of see it coming in super Telegraph that you get out of the way the second charging horse
is the same thing around that is a 21 to hit that will
that will do it uh you make a strength saving throw please uh do so with Advantage thanks to the
bear 22 months yet uh yeah not quiet
there get on it I reckon uh that is a 14. 14 you save as it tramples you
you're able to bring your feet just beneath you so you're not flung across the battlefield you suffer seven points
minus three four points of damage multiple points it takes so as it
crashes against the Shield you see uh uh Goose uh Shield slams it and that ice
shatters off in a in a wave um it takes five points of cold damage nice
uh is that let's say that that's the same horse that
um uh all he had done damage to so Five Points of damage you said
uh Five Points of damage uh he's also gonna use a reaction to reduce that uh
he's gonna Parry that uh and reduces it to zero you take no damage the second
Knight though as the horse tramples it kind of still bumps you're able to kind of absorb that effect using your body you know how to move you you know you've
been around um the Knight will swing his spear down to try to poke you through the chest and
misses you move like an eel he's not used to it the last writer will have spill it off and is targeting the ranger
who's sitting in the back with the other uh militia members there and he's coming for you Judy
so his shot or his trample effect 14 plus 20 dirty twenty
oh yeah that'll hit give me a strength saving throw with Advantage please
okay
that's good enough the horse deals nine point of trample damage to you as the Hooves catch you and you feel some you
feel something crack something has just broken whether it's a rib you'll have to
assess later but something definitely caught and you feel something break and before you do it Mickey uh actually you
don't need to roll anything a bit of blood comes to your lips something inside of you it's not quite right and
the writer who's on top is the horse knocks and he will try to run his spear right through you as well
oh dang and I can't do anything nine twelve will miss
um as you're able to kind of Dodge out of the way the spear thrust kind of misses you entirely that's the first
group let's jump over to Corey and Linden as you guys are standing with the rest
of the population Declan is there kajal is with you and the mayor's with with you and Cassandra's there as well
amongst the plentitude of people and you two rolled uh so because Corey
rolled pretty well with the 15. Lyndon you rolled pretty low Corey you realize before anybody else
that something is very wrong one of the members that's beside you one of the mercy members that's watching one of the
people who works for kajal moves in a such a bizarre way he's the
only one who's not really looking at the battlefield and as you notice the steel or the flashes of metal on the
battlefield he draws a dagger and lunges forward towards iron smile
she brings up her Shield just in the nick of time but he watches the air or the knife catches her neck and she
starts to bleed as he has lunged at her Cassandra shouts out treachery but
you're the first to act Corey what will you do
um fudge okay this person is in front of me there yeah
so uh the dwarf is watching she's like 10 feet behind you it walked and he's literally like adjacent to you
okay is there anyone behind this person no it's well one of them is walking
towards iron smell one of them well give me an inside check please okay
oh who how many are actually oh this is this is good this is fine uh 19
19. there's one more who hasn't revealed himself yet and you watch with his weapon he's approaching towards
Cassandra yeah The Dilemma that you may have as the
weapon he yeah if you're trying to input some sort of
moral dilemma here you have failed that's fine that [ __ ] is gonna die I will say the twins uh already mentioned
murdering her so yeah yeah yeah but we don't get to murder her if he does
I think well for curry it's not necessarily that she has to be the one to do it just that Cassandra has to die
so I am going to like instinctually because I uh I did not think that uh
Corey did not believe that they were gonna get into any fights does not have any like seriously fight worthy spells
prepared um but does have one okay um so is immediately going to um
sort of cast uh from like sheer fear
um Frost fingers towards this uh the starry mixed aberson the person
stabby mcstabbers that's his name yeah that's actually his name the
long-running mcstabberson family it's a very actually his name yet so my mom called
me stabby but nobody else uh okay
which is why I don't know who's around but I'm gonna try and aim it away from any of the people like judicial people
that I care about and just try and kill this guy yeah you can absolutely just
catch him uh you'll catch a tree into the effect but you won't hit anything else you just like aimed it just a
little bit this way and then you get Cassandra no because Cassandra's standing with other people as well but
but I could hit the mail Cassandra's gonna be killed anyway don't worry about her she'll die
um so it is a constitution save of 13.
no he fails as he's walking up bleed in hand he pays you no mind and he's pulling his blade back and you can hear
and see Kajol is like super surprised by this the beckland is scrambling for her
weapons and this blast of cold how much damage uh
11 points of frost damage this person goes from
being in the midst of an assassination attempt from being alive to being entirely Frozen in place in one movement
they go from being a living breathing human flesh being to being a frozen ice statue within a second and with this out
of reaction Kajol kicks out as a reaction towards it and that's like a T-1000
shatters and scatters into a pile of ice on the ground he is absolutely dead
okay uh so Corey just killed a human like a or a sentient creature right yes
sorry we'll think about the consequences later but right now Curry is scared for her life and her brothers and will turn
immediately back to London uh and just like wide-eyed looking at him not even
embracing the fact that she just murdered someone um
love her all right are you moving are you doing anything else Cory
[Music] uh [Music] foreign [Music]
will not leave her brother's side until he is ready to move okay with this the
creature that was the human that's running towards Cassandra with the cloak on one of the mercs sees what you've
done directly from moves towards the actual biggest threat and with this
we'll draw a blade and you watch as he pulls it like trying to be kind of careful not to draw the eye of Kajol and
of becklin moves you see him coming Lyndon I need you to make a perception check please
oh not bad with its advantage uh you're not poisoned anymore
not poisonous no no you're not everything I've been rolling so far has been yeah and that's that's okay the poison just
ended up adrenaline oh God I'm gonna die and
suddenly that's overcome the poison um uh 18. 18. do you see this guy walk
he ignores you you're some you know tiny a ladder and he doesn't care about you he's walking around you and he gets out
of range you can get an attack of opportunity if you want before he brings his blade out to try to shank your sister
uh he's going for Corey 100 he just froze the guy to death yeah yeah yeah 100 I am I'm going for him then as soon
as he walks forwards my instinct I like London's in panic mode already um but he's starting to get slightly
better at not not immediately break uh shutting down when in situations like
this um he's just had this situation with his sister watched her kill a guy he hasn't
had time to process that he sees somebody going for him so he's just gonna go out with a like a stupid
unarmed attack because he's got nothing in his hands okay probably gonna try and hit him with his spell book all right
make an attack Roll I Love It all right it's Acro uh that that's actually not bad a 16 but
16 just hits you deal with 16 on the dice wait wait wait 16 on the dice do I have a negative modifier or positive
modifier I am proficient in unarm strikes as everybody is so that would be an 18 but I have a negative strength took me to a 17. okay I'm good you deal
one damage as he walks past and surprisingly you actually twist your
body into it it's a good form if Goose were here he'd appreciate it probably as you knock this guy and as you you punch
him in the ear and he turns to face you really no just shout stop at him like
and what and while he looks at you in the face he draws his blade out and runs it through your sister's stomach
oh uh I am going to cast Shield as a reaction perfect with the normally a 15
would hit I imagine uh you would imagine correctly and with
this the Arcane Ward what does it look like the shield that surrounds you [Music]
think it looks together metal tree that is reminiscent
of mother nice oof these Vines and leaves that appear around you the blade whatever is this and as his blade does
not find purchase in your body he pulls it back looks into panic and begins to move away [ __ ] [ __ ] that didn't work out
at all and you watch as he begins to turn you have a oh you've used your reactions you
don't get anything surprisingly the person who now comes to you watches
Cassandra of all people looks to you looks to Linden
there's like a the penny that finally drops for her
and do you look different yep and you cast the spell
and
as she looks she looks past Nick both of you make a sudden make an
inside check because the penny might have just dropped for you too as well
12 okay
thank you um 21. she is not any student that has gone to
the Tower of um sorcery has either lapel or something that indicates that they've
been there that they're a student there you guys have were given um promise uh signets to indicate that
whether you'd be in the white red or black black robes whenever you'd graduate she Bears none of these marks
you suddenly realize she has flunked out she has been kicked out of the school she didn't do well
enough and she's back home permanently and in that moment though
you do notice and it's bizarre because her eyes flash black and as she pulls
from the ground in front of her you watch this Eldritch blast of magic they
should be well passed Beyond her you've never seen her do anything like this as she lets loose for a moment speaking
in infernal tongues as this Eldritch blast shoots from her and screams towards this guy
she tries to hit him from behind with a five her Eldritch blast will miss
and Scorch the ground he watches these little tendrils of hands kind of reaching out looking vaguely
lizard-like or like these clawed fans kind of try to grab at the ankles that this creature she is angry that anybody
would even dare to consider to come after her or anyone she's around but her
spell misses and now uh Linden it is your turn
all right uh I'm Gonna Roll to see how I do before I then describe it okay does a does a does a 16 hit that
guy's amethyst it does okay so what happens then is Lyndon uh freaks out he tries he punches this guy in the ear
with his offhand as well um and then and then he tries to stamp uh Corey he walks away and I'm like that
guy's Gotta Die um and immediately I get I get my hand into a position where I just start doing
some um runes in the air and my my kind of doctor strange like it's uh it's leaving behind
um traces wherever my fingers are going and kind of like finger tutting I'm leaving behind all these very
complicated rooms and then I focus on on myself with my other hand and start doing similar ones and right where my uh
my the poison of my system is still kind of just pulsating round you see like green anybody watching sees
this green Mist starting to leave through the pores of my skin as I suck the poison out of my skin and I put it
into the runes that I'm creating in front of me and then as soon as the green Mist hits it it coalesces into the center and it's like uh rotating all of
green goo fires off as I cast Rave sickness and it slams this guy right in the back and he needs to make a
constitution saving throw please
[Music] as well I rolled a 19 so that's a save
okay so he's not poisoned but he probably doesn't matter because he's taking 15 points of poison damage as he
walks away you watch as he suddenly grasps onto his throat his eyes begin to bulge Jaw free style as he turns around
to face you I think for flavor as well like I could it's a spell that like hits and just
dissipates but I'm like focusing to keep it there and I'm like keeping it Crossing around the vitamins of his body
he falls down to when he's staring at you and he can't get his last words out
before he just Falls over his skin literally boiling off of his body this guy is just dead
Giga dead Corey
he's kind of not wearing this together now we've murdered somebody each I think Kari is gonna look up to you just again
panicked eyes and just say uh
as we cut back to the other siblings we're not nearly doing as well but maybe
not as bad either Juniper we start with you on top of you a knight with his War
Horse trying to fight you and trample you to death uh you're the top of the round what will you do
uh oh okay uh so he's like right on top
of me isn't he yeah he's yeah he tried to trample you the horse's rearing back he's got his spear that he's trying to
run through you over and over and over again look
look okay I want to go
to gush him okay um I just want to offer something quickly yeah
the spare spirit it's been is with you and you get advantage and strength checks and strength saving throws or if
you wanted to do anything strength related
I know I get a I know I get a Advantage but it's still a plus one
better than my minus one right true and I punched a guy in the ear that was being faced Lyndon punched someone with
a book yeah like you could do yeah whatever you want I have a sickle I have
a sickle in uh like on me essentially that's my that's my other weapon claim
to fame yeah let's go yeah I'm wondering if I can literally just like like slash at the horse enough to really
really really spook it yeah you can certainly try 100 yeah I've either Buck him or you know just literally uh make
an animal make it make a nature check let's see if you can get yourself Advantage uh nature first to figure out the best
place to hit and for some reason you're slowly drifting to the side I need to fix where I could see you
there we go got you like all right we're gonna keep adjusting the camera that is
uh another 18. nice you've seen well you have Julie the horse back at the farm you've seen uh all the handle horses you
know that they cover their eyes because horses can be prone to panic the eyes are the best place to go and with this
you have advantage on the strike if you so choose excellent well I think I'm just gonna like grab this sickle off me and try
strike it the horsepower it's it's got its baleful eyes covered up make an attack roll and
you have advantage jaybone doesn't murder [Laughter]
family my first murder sorry go ahead that is a
19. absolutely you hit roll your world although it is just my sickle so it's
not crazy damage uh that's just a two it's it's seen
amounts of damage but it's still damaged and he watches the horse uh let me roll for this
[Music] uh I'm gonna call this are you gonna make horse noises I'm gonna make
yes yes the horse saves
um on wanting to break away or buck uh he will Buck but he won't he won't flee
let's see if the Knight is able to hold on we'll call it DC 10 it's not super complicated
oh it was on a four but it's on 11. the Knight is able to hold on just as as best he can he's holding on to the
Bucking Horse but he's he's okay still you got it in the eye the horse does not go anywhere sadly [ __ ]
the background can I movies right over me I mean they get it he would get a free shot at you
but you couldn't move away there's a basically between you and him there's this wall and he came at you he could jump on the other side of the wall and
create some space yeah yeah all right let's give that a go he's got a shot at me he's gonna try to
stab you in the butt would you get a little bit of cover from the wall well with the natural 20 doesn't much matter
does it and he gets me he catches you and you
find that the thing that broke that crack that you heard was something in your ribs and as you go to jump you get
that stabbing pain that kind of makes you move a little bit slowly the opening he has as he pokes you from behind you
suffer uh so it's he's using uh he doesn't have a shield he's using both his hands yikes
uh 13 points of damage Juniper okay does
that knock you unconscious no nice as you move away the spear as
you run you go so fast or you fall over you hear the snap of this P or break as
it's partially embedded in the back of your shoulder his spear is broken and you have a piece of spear in your back
how far do you want to go all these within 30 feet of you you can get to him if you wanted to
so the walls giving me a little bit of cover is there any other kind of place that I
can either there's an enormous tree there's the victory tree that's right beside you that goes up about 50 feet
I've got a cracked rib and a spear in me it's just
but I think did you say it's like Jesus yeah just like Jesus
I'm not that he had great trips probably cracked up you're right
yeah okay both of your name starts with j okay what's going on j-bone
I feel like maybe though she's gonna try it it's uh like she's in a bad way okay
you wanna try to climb the tree really just yeah she just can't stand her ground okay well you have Advantage courtesy of the bear totem so give me an
Athletics check with Advantage as you climb uh
Athletics that is a 14. yeah there are plenty of handhold footholds it's brutal
because you're bleeding in the Spears in your back but you make it about 10 feet up in height right I think she's got like the
adrenaline as the shock kind of like starts to set in of just like if I don't
do this I might die then she's not wrong um okay that was your turn next up is
Ollie
Oleander you muted he's muted hello hello welcome back hi
uh can I just get a quick sweep of the battlefield to see where the knights are then yes so there's two uh there's one
that's beyond the wall that just came after your sister and there's two like immediately within uh
10 like they're both within 20 feet of you Okay cool so what I'm gonna do is I'm
realizing that this battle has just happened so fast that Ollie has another chance to set up he's going to reach for
the mask and fumble for it can't find it with shaking hands looking at the injured Forest looking at Judy who's
also nursing a like a little spear in our back he's going to put the mask on and the hands are going to come to a
dead prom take a deep breath and is going to look over and Survey the battlefield and is going to point
towards the two that are near Juni and it's very if there are two major unique correct uh there's one near Junior there
are two near Goose all right um look over the Jews and say you got this goose
not a problem not a problem yeah I'm going to bring my hands
together flip them and inverse them at the same time and then just like this and I'm going to entangle over on that
one over there okay so it's a strength saving through I think strength saving through
uh 17 uh I think my spell save DC is yeah it's
big it's higher it's a 13. you wanted the horse the tramples like the the vines that are trying to grow and
there's sadly no effect uh you wore the mask
yeah nothing happened uh no something definitely happened okay so as you cast
the spell and the mask is put upon your face I want you to tell me what it feels like
for Ollie when his body begins to outside of his controller outside of his
wishes at least for the time being as it begins to grow thick fur a muzzle grows
on his face and as he takes on unwittingly the form of a large wolf
yeah yeah I am just going to run towards I'm
gonna let a big Groupon howl first oh
I'm gonna run straight towards the one where junior is and just interpose between them because I know I use my action for entangle
um but if it breaks base contact it's gonna get bit okay this
this wolf that you are is a large Wolf the size of a horse as
you turn into you look like wolf from
your dreams the wolf that you've known for a long time except bigger
and as you scream towards the the one towards Juni the horse immediately upon your arrival
do you want you could easily get to him if you want to you can't attack this turn but you could get to him yeah I'm
gonna get to him and then I wanna I wanna do something when I get to them uh to him okay the horse immediately with
it or it needs to make a wisdom saving throw and I'll give a disadvantage here as it is scared out of its Mind of a
wolf that's bigger than it coming right at it the I'll roll the four and a one the
horse immediately turns and the Knight cannot keep it in battle let's see if the Knight can hold on
this is what Judy wanted to do and fail to do uh the Knight is able to hold on but the
horse is taking off if you want to you can get a reaction as an attack of opportunity as it's running
and turning away from you hell yeah I'm going to do that um but before I do I'm going to look
towards the night I'm going to use my telepathic connection I'm gonna say to the night you are my sister now I'm
gonna hurt you um and you hear the night [ __ ] himself
as thirsty is it you actively hear his bridges
yeah everybody like the London's like I've got
it yeah he did amazing so I'll make an opportunity
attack yeah after that to the giant wolf so yeah if you I'll just roll a D20 and you can tell me yep
oh natural 16. absolutely are you targeting the horse or the Knight
uh the night preferably I'd like to just like tear the night off and just like eat the night down okay you just you
pull that night off man yeah right off pulling that night off okay so
just Unleash the Beast Within you and pull that night off yeah yeah so I need you to make uh so you you
have either claws or a bite attack which do you want to do bite bite for sure okay uh roll two D6 please
did you just roll to see whether you want to do them French you know what I should let the dice decide all right Bob at 10 I'll do
a red jerk uh six on the d6's uh gym six okay
10. I said above the ten instead above a ten yeah no rude joke for you sorry sorry
okay so he takes six points of damage we'll put the root joke on our patreon everybody
we start a patreon for this Dragon let's just for the room 13. you don't knock him prone off the
horse but you do okay bite into him and you blood like his pooling and it's he tastes awful but you know you did damage
him riding away all right and I think that's about it
um people the other villagers were like around the battlefield now see this enormous physical role player and you're
right here um and they are scared like the villagers that just saw you turn into this enormous thing this is Magic that
they've never seen before there was a dude there a second ago now there's a huge wolf that's like biting people uh
goose that's me what are you doing um so would I have got an opportunity
attack when they ran past me into they have like right oh uh didn't you use your reaction to reduce the damage that's why you didn't get it right oh
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right all right DM sometimes
um all righty uh goose is going to run at one of the dudes uh he has a six foot
vertical leap with his strength modifier okay um uh as he runs towards him he's gonna
be like I dig it uh what that's that's not my name your
flies aren't done and he just leaps at him okay
um got him poor cat is freaking out are you attacking the wait are you attacking the one that's already been damaged or are you attacking the one that's unhurt
because one of them has been like iced over and like looks kind of like a dog's breakfast already
uh the one that is undamaged okay absolutely
um we would prefer to hit him he's on his horse and he's starting to turn around to come back for you like the
momentum he carried it past you he's grabbing the reins and turning spear in and looking with murderous intent looking for you and you suppose he
Wheels around goose is just heading towards him to cut him off uh leaps at him like side on
okay come on oh uh that is a 13 to hit as you leap he brings this Spear and
deflects the hammer blow uh ricochets off uh Landing in the
ground okay that's him okay with that
at that moment uh let me do this Goose I need you and the uh individual
beside you but first I need you to make it dexterity saving throw as a volley of arrows from the rest of the Battalion
mercenaries that are shooting indiscriminately are shooting in the midst of it you and him are caught in it
so DC 12 deck saving throw please uh I got a 16. nice the arrows do not
find purchase on you let me roll for the guard they don't hit him let me roll for his horse
the horse suffers 1d6 damage two points of damage
okay uh and with that I want
actually uh so that's gonna be their turn but I'm gonna give you a little description in the middle here
the hulking figure of that half ogre this formidable foe
leading with an enormous battle ax probably the size of goose because he's the shortest of the family
um he's leading this warband through the chaos you watch as a few militia members
are trying to do their best the guy with the sausages Ali I'm sorry to say it's
not sausages coming out of his stomach as the ax catches that guy and he pushes
through it one swap motion that half ogre has cut that militia member in half
and he's seeing the Lord of you up at the top it seems that for some of you this is
not a game all right it's the knights turns and then we're gonna go to I like to believe
that like because there's a huge prize on the line for the best gruesome death everybody this year has just gone super
all out with special effects and magic and like they're really buildings and stuff and we just haven't started
murdering people everybody else is just playing along oh his blood's just fake
yeah so uh the knights that are there the one that's beside you Goose that you
went at he's gonna try to attack you he can't trample you but the horse will try to hoof you in the face cool uh Ted will miss the Knight with
his spear with a plus three ooh not 20. he had to use his spear to kind of
deflect he's gonna only get to do his 2d6 damage so that is a total of 10 minus three
seven damage that's the one are you still standing oh yeah I I've taken off of my Max eight
points I've taken one hit point oh sad that 10 page pay okay nice okay rude uh
he takes five cold damage though he does I don't like that um okay as he stands like taking like
seven damage so he can that's fair that looks like dying
um you're the GM you can just give the guy an extra five hit points he has an extra five hit once out of nowhere um
for every subscriber uh the guard will gain suddenly extra hit points I guess
uh the the other so he'll stand there and he'll stab you pull his spear
through that's your blood that's your blood he's making you bleed and the other guard will come around back
actually the other guard there's a wolf there all right let me see what he decides to do I'm gonna say
it no no one please makes me bleed my own blood the guard chooses life instead of
fighting a wolf the size of a house and he will run coward yeah but he's gonna
run uh directly opposite and away um and he will actually just leave the
battle actually let's make it this way as he leaves realizing that there's enormous wolf behind
the half ogre will catch him because it's more cinematic this week reganis will catch
him off of the horse looks of the other mercs around and with
one hand pops his head like a watermelon before throwing his body
to the ground okay that's all that quote unquote bad guys let's bring Greg honest in shall we
let's just show you the size that he is sure and as he's walking up he's flanked by
two more guards and he's making a direct beeline towards where the wolf is Corey and Lyndon
you guys are pretty far away from the actual Battlefield do you have any what's your longest longest ranged spell
just out of curiosity what's uh what's what's pretty far uh
give us a ball pack you're about 200 feet away cool yeah I've got uh I've got some 60
foot spells I've got expeditious Retreat which allows me to Double Dash true so I can get there at a couple of rounds
probably okay yeah and and likewise I can face step
30 feet and then run and then I can cost a 60 foot so on the first
yeah on the first round both of us could move 30 Dash as our action another 30
and then faced up another 30. okay so that's 90 foot in one round so let me ask you then let me phrase it this way
is your intention to in to engage in the fight or are you gonna stay where you are
with a quick glance around the stuns where we are it's like if it's obvious that there's no other threats here
well what's happening behind you is that becklin has is not going into the fight she's tending to cudgel's wounds in her
neck Cassandra is retreating with her guards from a distance but she's watching she looks to both of you
and then she begins she's leaving she doesn't want to be involved she doesn't want to die and she's done what she thinks she had to if there's no other
necessities alive here then uh Corey and London will look at each other and discuss what to do okay so let's get
that cut scene in then in the middle of the fight it's both of your turn you watch the half ogre begins to March up
the hill he's this he he's big you've seen your brother turn into a huge wolf
of Epic Proportions your sisters climbed up a tree and goose is standing there one on one with a knight uh there's
clamor and fighting blood everywhere there are people screaming and running away the militia members are attacking
some unarmed uh villagers in the distance as well you have your pick to choose from
uh London will as usual kind of follow Cory's lead and look at her and see what
she's trying to read on her face what she's thinking run
Corey is looking at this giant being walking towards their siblings and
without even hesitating um it turns to London and uh and says we
need we need to help him yes um and as soon as soon as London agrees
says yes he starts doing the it's you know our turns are assumed it's okay perfect
so Corey you're up first then that's that's casting a spell as well so Corey you're back in the initiative now yeah
okay uh Facebook first runs first I am going
to are you casting a spec like I've seen
you starting to cast assuming is expeditious Retreat yeah you've seen me working on it it's the
one that I said I said okay then I will trust that Lyndon will be okay I'm gonna face step
30 feet nice towards Journey you want she is and it looks cool because you
walk through like kind of your own Arcane Shield that you'd created of it looks like you're walking through feathers or rather leaves and it leaves
behind like the scent um 30 feet closer okay you're about 170 feet away from your sister
yeah and then I'm going to run and um Dash if I can I don't think I can uh so first
up I think is a bonus Center yeah
110 feet away from your sister so I'm not moving you on the table because it's no you're fine uh I'm not going to move
the mini quite a bit you're 110 feet away perfect okay um simultaneously then as uh Journeys
going unless there was other people no that's it's you yeah yeah um London is is like there's a little
concern on his face because he's uh he just mentioned this morning last morning whenever it was that they finally got
their level up um that he's only just worked out the Kinks in this film but he's casting expeditious Retreat which is a
transmutation spell and as it looks for London it's again some of these sort of in the air um symbols
but then it starts to affect the very fibers of the muscles of his legs it starts to elongate his his uh his bones
and his legs a little and the twitch five is stuck going and it's a very painful process for him but he's working
on it and he's and he's and with this situation of like life or death for his siblings he knows that it's now or never
get this right or not um so he casts Expedition retreat in and he kind of like goes down to his knees a
little bit but then he's back up again and that allows me to take the dash action as a bonus action for the next minute so you hear the bonus if you're
behind you as a sound of bones breaking and elongating and re-knitting in muscle staring you hear Cassandra actually more
than that one you hear her just throw up like oh my God you're all nasty man what
the [ __ ] um okay I'll pay it never mind but I'll
Dash is a bonus stash is my action run is my thing and I should be next to Corey perfect both of you about 110 feet
away behind she's like running slower but I'm just catching up because my newfound speed
okay with this it is gorgonis's turn there is a cart that's sort of Laden in
the middle of the battlefield that acts as like a waypoint where most of the battle was meant to happen he's going to
walk up to the cart he picks it up and he's gonna Chuck it at the wolf so
uh and the car gets picked up you watch he grabs it with one hand
and throws it in Direction Aldi I need you to please make a Dick's dirty saving throw
okay I'm okay with that uh
there it's a comfy
it's a comfy uh 12. 12. 10 page p and
you're uh it does 12 sadly is not enough as the enormous cart breaks on your back you suffer it's
not back breaking huh um you suffer 13 points of bludgeoning damage
too soon so as your I'll tell you your stat for this uh as your wolf form you
have 16 you have 18 head points nice is that including 10 PHP that is not
including 10 points attempt HP from you yes that's 25. yeah yeah so you're still standing in your
wall form as the as the rubble clears you watch We're gone as well it's
surprised to see you still standing uh and he just out of frustration smashes the
horse that was part of that other guy's um and he just smashes it and then keeps walking he's covered in blood this guy's
a jerk you guys this guy's a jerk just so you know that's that's one way
of how I would have phrased it yeah it's not real he's a real piece of jerk uh
yeah his guard is going to charge up uh he
has a dash he flanks Goose the other one flanks Goose as well but they don't get to attack this certain Juniper you're up
you're at the top of the tree your brother is surrounded by three soldiers one horse and there's a half ogre coming
for that sugary sweetie booty what do you want to do
all I've got is about an hour um not like them I don't have cool
things you're cool Judy's cool
no she's not that's okay though oh yes she is she's awesome is what you see
this is from her point of view so they're all coming they're all coming on
to Goose aren't they yeah don't phrase it like that yeah they're all they're
all listening [Music]
muscles yeah well a little
um do I have a better shot at Eddie over the others they're all clear line it
says the best shot you have is probably the ogre just because he's big and tall there's nothing covering him but even
the other ones who are immediately beside you they're right there
[Music] let's be okay I think I'm gonna have to
go for the the giant one okay sorry
oh [ __ ] that's a does a 27 here let me
double check my notes 27 you guys I don't know I'm not sure I'm not sure is this uh is this an
ancient red dragon yeah it hits yeah sure for sure it would be very scary if it didn't
yeah that would be uh freaking terrifying okay six seven eight Ah that's a nine
damage he will use this reaction turns his skin into sparsely Stone he will
reduce this he will uh nine becomes six okay he
takes six points of damage damn it okay okay anything else for you Juniper
um
I mean I don't don't really have any other crazy like uh bonus actions or
anything okay then uh are you staying up in your tree are you gonna climb further up there's
there are more branches above will it help me get a better line of sight
not necessarily no no you can do this you could do this thing
which allows me later to knock you down further from higher up the train deal more damage so that could be fun for me pretty fun that's pretty fun if I can
see them then I'm all good um okay yeah I might just keep trying to
warn ing it can't be God they're coming for you Goose they're coming on to you oh
are they coming for me he said surrendered but of course that's something get out
uh actually next stop so we're gonna just
re rejink the initiative because all of you are now roughly in the same fight it's the top of the round so this would be Corey at 15 after
um after Juniper get it girl you got this
and then it's Aldi Hari is as soon as London catches up Curry then face steps
once more dirty feet away um I'm gonna try and
uh and then use the rest of my movement so I think I'm right now you're 50 feet
away yeah yep yeah cool um so you're actually on here now so you're
50 feet away uh you would be moving up this is you so 40 you're kind
of like in the thick of things in fact you're very close you're just at the wall you're just at the wall and you can
see everybody and everybody can see you brilliant uh okay
I'm gonna stop and sort of take a a good stance
um and uh sort of whisper some words underneath my breath um and pull back as though I have like a
uh my own bow and arrow um but it's like a silvery uh webbing okay and I'm going
to cost um mind sliver so is that a bonus section uh it is a can trip so you did you dash
no you didn't Dash you did 60 Oh no you're fine yeah absolutely yeah who do you want to Target
section that's that bonus section movement and then action yeah yeah the the the big old dude what's the
what's the range of uh mind sliver 60 feet okay I think it's an in-saving
throw right uh it is yes
natural three I don't think that saves we love to hear it
that is beneficial what did you say the distance between uh Corey and the big
guy she is uh 41 foot away exactly I did nothing
um I rolled a one on damage as you damage it you watch as like a
tiny trickle of blood comes out of his ear but he hasn't used his brain in a really long time so sadly it wasn't that
effective it's mostly vestigial it's more like disorientating because it's um
um psychic hurtfully fingers crossed uh yes sure it looks like he's confused
with about everything in life how about that nice if it does have a secondary effect
uh it's a D6 of his next second trip thank you it's a very good smell it's a
great care trip because there are very few things that Target intelligence but let's not talk design questions really it's really good one one two punch first
setting up the next thing to that's gonna they can just do it safe yeah um
you could stand behind the wall you don't need to hide because the kids see you but at least it gives you partial
cover against anybody yeah I just want some cover okay wolf brother it is your turn as I am
wolf brother uh quick question yeah uh are the twins
within range of my it's been there so your it's been beer was put here I'll
find out I think so now uh it's not just when it's castles whenever they walk into the room yeah yeah uh let me get
this here uh let's do this uh you put it here
60 feet uh Corey is right now in Linden maybe on
his turn will be but Corey's uh Cory's in for sure you'll get bathed in it HP adventurous strength checks and saving
prayers uh [Music]
I might actually like give a small little growl bar towards uh atheist in
Bear okay and they get it to move because it can move just closer to get hopefully get Linen in it or get um
close the gap between linen sorry sorry the radius of it just in that tree if possible so it can like still maintain
it with Juni
if I only had the time to actually play with it so you want um you need to be in it but you don't
care about okay so you want to move it yes you can absolutely make sure of it all the siblings are in it yeah yeah how far do you want to move how far can you
move it and then we'll move into it yeah and then we'll move into it I'm just worried about another there's no more throwing cards but maybe a rock or
something okay uh yeah just it's the debate to the tree if possible it's like the the outer rims of it you got it
there yeah you're good you're good uh there we go that'll do okay so now what do uh I'm
going to look up it I'm gonna look up a journey and then look back I'm curious and then look back
to the journey to see if Junior communicates anything book of
be safe okay um I look goose
you look like you're going to be able to handle yourself yeah the day of the office yes nobody can get through that cake hang on
we haven't had our cake shot today there you go yeah yeah yeah before Goose dies send him up now
all right so we'll brother is just going to charge full health towards the big guy and trying to jump and leap and just
like attack straight on top of it almost like trying to pounce on top of it possible the the bigger yeah yeah and
actually since I'm large yeah I want to make an attack what I want to try and do is I'd like to
try and shove the ergor okay so you can you can either
so okay you leap I'll I'll say this if
that's what you want to do I'll give you disadvantage of the attack but if you manage it you get both your bike bite and you get to knock him to the ground
but if you miss that's it right like you miss entirely your attention I'm okay for that all right go for it
you guys watches this wolf you have disadvantage on the attack yeah
you're jumping at his chest with all your weight trying to shove him down he's big
[Music] oh dang it his AC's not that high but as
you jump up he catches you in the air and then he tosses you to go you don't
take any damage but your attack misses and he looks at you dead in the face and Chuckles
I could use a new wolf pounce as the dog is upset by that uh but that's what he
says it's good timing perfect timing um all right guys no no it's fine it's fine it's fine
he's perfect so although you've used your bonus action to move the big the spirit I think you've used your action
you've moved there's nothing else right nothing else goose Goose uh at this moment I need to roll
another D4 give me a second his Battlefield things happen huh number four
uh perfect an extra member of the uh
militia not the town's militia but the mercenaries has finished killing off another one of the militia members and
stumbles onto the battlefield on the far end um he's coming up from behind where
Lyndon is but doesn't get to go quite yet but just know that behind you Linden a militia member has finished killing
our mercenary member has just pushed off the body of a militia member office
blade is cleaning it he looks hurt already but he's locked eyes with you and he's coming for you in a minute
um Goose you're up okay so uh uh Ollie is your aura thing
like per round does it get reapplied the temp HP or anything just the one time
just the one yeah it's just the one time yeah the thing that's all the time is the
strength checks and saving verse so if you want to shove or grapple yeah yeah
um as the as the bird moved towards Linden
and Linden was thrust into the aura of it hit the muscles fibers still twitched in it and he thought it was the remnants
of his expeditious retreat but it's just his muscles growing a little bit because of the Bears the Captain America episode yes exactly
little boy [Laughter]
this is a one you know when you think about it this will be a turn uh will exist so what do you what do you
do in Goose you've got two guards that have run up for leaving the enormous half ogre behind you make it you know
what your practice on the battlefield you fought before not necessing battlefield but you you've done bar fights before give me an Insight check
um yeah you know how to read a battlefield you're sort of like a mini battle General uh I rolled a 15 for a 14. nice
you know that they're not intending to hit you they're intending of holding on to you to let the ogre come and rip you
apart their intention is to knock you down or hold you steady for the gaganas to come
up and literally tear you a new one like physically
so they're not gonna hit me uh they're gonna grab onto you and make sure you can't move which may be worse
they're gonna try and try and incapacitate you uh which one has been damaged the one
that's directly on the horse in front of you all right uh I'm gonna be like hey mate I bet you pull your pants all the
way off to pee and then I smack him with a hammer my mama says it's better to sit because
that way you don't Splash anything so not even casting like vicious mockery
you know all right uh that is a natural 20. uh let me check my notes
the old narrow Twitter we gotta you gotta say it right please you gotta say it right uh yeah
I can do this can you get AJ to say it can you get AJ to Commitment just once just to
celebrate me being here the NATO or the twin what about just
like the [Music]
well the remains of the Guard are pushed by feet because as you smash into it your Hammer goes clean through his chest
very nice and as he falls off the horse bolts it doesn't have a rider
anymore and there's a ogre coming behind it um do you want to take an attack of
opportunity on the horse nah I'll keep my reaction I Look to do next to me I'm like still okay still
Kane on this and he looks at you and it looks at the ogre and it says stoking
so it was actually bad so the giant the giant wolf toss somebody apart before
right yes uh no he's scared he scared somebody off they didn't actually kill anybody else if you haven't killed this
person no I ripped someone off I did rip someone off I don't know if you killed anybody yet
three of the five of us have murdered a living human cool I keep track of that yeah yeah yeah it's
a no for later I don't know for sure all I know is that they tasted them yeah yes and and they fled they got scared
that horses fled and they're just choosing life instead of Dying by Wolves so Goose you've used your action you
have movement and bonus action left what will you do that uh just about does it for goose the
abilities of goose in this in this here oh no that can win
that guy's showing off he's doing like he's standing up on the back of that horse as he's as he's running away on it
well it's the best I can do there's no mounted mini um but Linden you're up
all right as linen as Linden is running um and because I'm not there with a physical map to actually count this out
myself does Linden get the impression that with his movement and his bonus action Dash with 60 feet of movement he
would be able to get within 30 feet of that ogre yes yes all right then he's going to go
ahead with that he is going to run to um within 30 feet hopefully like exactly 30 feet away and if he's got any movement
left he's going to keep a hold of it so he can back away again after he's done what he's about to do uh 30 feet is actually like right by the
wall so you have 20 feet of movement left or 25 feet of movement left after that little exercise if you want
excellent so I will uh I will use my movement I'll use my Dash as a bonus
I'll get to within 30 feet of him and then as I'm running I am I'm doing
my hideous laughter on him he's gonna have uh he's gonna have the wisdom saving throw but because of the one-two
punch from the old twins working together the mind's level will take off a D4 I think it is from his saving throw
um London quickly chunks down the hand and gets a couple of the tats out he's he's the last of his tax he's gonna need
to make more um uh attacks and feathers and he just crushes them up and throws them out and
again he's not doing anything like showy or funny or saying any joke because that small Goose's territory he's just
manipulating the mind and making the ogre get enchanted into thinking everything's hilarious okay so the ogre
has a minus one to a saving throw and a D4 so I'll ask you Corey please roll that D4 now to see what we're working
with
you're muted so you'll need to tell me two perfect so that's a minus three to saving throw what's the DC
the DC is 13. I need a 16 or better to make this never doubt there's a 16 sadly the
laughter does not uh he doesn't find anything amusing other than
other than the fact that you know what's funny about all of this nothing
all right Lyndon Lyndon is going to freak out because that was like all of
his components and he's starting to feel pretty exhausted from the expenditure of magic so he is going to use the rest of
his movement to go and stand right right by um uh Corey like between Corey and the other
perfect hopefully like on the on the on the correct side of the wall from the ogre too yeah yeah yeah
in fact a little extra movement perfect gragonis goes now and he is standing toe-to-toe with an
enormous direwolf which is or not a direwolf but rather an enormous wolf uh
that He is wanting to skin because he's never seen that before uh and he is a
fighter and he wants to fight so he's going to try to attack you with this enormous battle ax that he's using with
both hands as he winds up [Music] and trying to take uh well your head off
he has only plus five to hit so there's a chance he misses here and I bet he does like no damage so it's
fine eleven does not hit
with this the ax the enormous two-handed battle ax plants itself into the dirt
with all of his strength and you watch as it is embedded in the dirt
let's see if he's able to pull it out yeah he is okay he puts all his back
into it rips the ax out and he won't turn his back to you but he will move
closer to Goose and his allies and that'll be his turn uh goose make a
contested strength check and you have Advantage let's go so this would be Athletics or or um acrobat it's up to
you right because you're the uh yeah it'll be Athletics oh 18.
uh 13 plus 6 19. the first one tries to grab your arms
and knock the hammer out of your hands but just get off of me he doesn't quite like you said about Goose being a bar fight this is like a much more his speed
like they're brawling they're trying to tussle with him he's like throwing one into the other he's like getting around them
uh and the other one will do the same uh 15.
19 again with this yeah you're kind of dancing around there but oh it's you can almost hear the Benny Hill music playing
as they're doing their best or bashing around when I kind of I gotta bump him on the butt
and you lead him into his buddy uh they both missed missed they're not able to get onto you the extra Merc that's
coming from behind can he get to you guys yes he can
I did tell you there was another one coming and he manages to get behind Linden and
Corey he's gonna go after um let's roll the D4
one two is Linden three four is Corey Corey he comes at you from behind sword and
hit or Spirit hand he's gonna uh no it's a blade it's a sword he tries to attack you or he will attack you
okay natural one at the last moment he trips on his own feet falls to the
ground uh lifts his head up he's covered with uh horse [ __ ] on his face as he stands
up right I meant to do that now I'm I'm scarier now uh that's his turn Jesus I
can't roll Juniper you're up and next up is Corey okay
um I obviously can't really see the grounds except for through the streams
there is a delay okay but can I get like a quick like layer I'm in a tree I'm in
a tree so there is my siblings there are two guards beneath you trying to grab
onto Goose there's the enormous half ogre facing off against the dire or the giant wolf and there's a soldier running
up behind Corey and they're all within range of your boat all of them the ogre the half ogre
is hurt the Two Soldiers beside uh goose are untouched and the soldier that ran up behind uh Corey is severely hurt
there's only so many I could take at a time I could only take one shot at a time oh I'm fine I'm a goose isn't
practically full HP he has one hit point missing are you really yeah oh okay well that does change
the thing is um okay do I try and go rule of cool or
yeah hell yeah ruler call this 100 well I mean I don't have an opinion just do what you want to do I do have like a
torch on me okay well I'm just thinking burning arrows
are like way cooler than normal arrows yeah yeah you could use your bonus
section to light your air on fire and shoot uh and now I would love that I love that I guess my main thing is do I
go for the guy about that Curry or do I go for
any well then do I go for the giant guy I feel like I'm confident that goose has
got it yeah until he doesn't have it until he does it yeah in which
case we can swoop in uh that's why I haven't been helping because I think that's good
that's good the legend of you guys have too much faith in Goose has got this we've got the case
it's not that we don't have faith it's that we are prioritizing
um who you going after I feel like the guy is already and does Corey have like sense that the
guy is coming behind her oh yeah she heard him fall his face first into into horse poop and he's right there she
can't they can't miss him um even still even still I think I'm
gonna go for him okay so user bonus section the arrow is lit making a tank
roll uh math
uh what's 17 plus seven someone more than enough uh so would this rule your
damage and add a D4 fire damage to the uh to the arrow that's how that's how I
like to do it how much yeah you did you did it you did the math we don't need to
know exactly um
nine damage the soldier finds an arrow burning through his chest as he looks
down in Surprise I I didn't think it would end this way
and falls behind covered in [ __ ] I did and that makes four of us and see if we
can get that let's see if we did the uh the old bingo so if you use your bonus action and your action movement wise
Juniper are you sitting in the tree I'm in this trick okay I I you know it's
actually k-i-l-l-i-n-g okay Corey you're up next a few more rounds in this tree and you
can claim squatters rides yeah great growing her up in all the year next Corey uh you saw the arrows stream
Street you hear a heavy thud behind you as the soldier dies uh the battlefield has two soldiers remaining in the
enormous half ogre okay I Look to Lyndon I give a very
short reassuring nod and I run towards uh the gods that are
surrounding goose and get 15 feet away from them where the wall is maybe
staying where the wall is okay yes um and I'm gonna yell out to Goose duck
I like Goose duck oh no oh okay
Duck Goose goose
um
um and I'm gonna I'm gonna cost uh I'm gonna cast the frost fingers again
okay you need to be here I think and then I don't know if it's gonna hit both of them
uh it hits one of them I can do it it's a cone so I can it's just that just
cone it if you're hang on let me double check if maybe you don't go around the wall yeah
if you don't stay behind the wall you could get both you could get all three of them I'm gonna not stay behind the
wall I'm gonna try and hit all three of them all right there is sadly like even
though Goose Ducks Goose do you want to use your reaction to duck yeah I'll give you my reaction to gopron
to go prone well I assume I would need to do that to get and out of the the range perfect as you
react you see the ice crystallizes in the air and catches all
three of them Goose I will say that you're just out of the range of it but you are prone which is gonna be great
for me okay so I feel like there's got to be some give and take yeah it's fine I reckon I reckon just roll really high
with the damage and just kill them all and then there's no no no I'm trying again yeah just do that let's see what
saving throw remind me so it is a um Frost fingers is Con 13. so they have
for all probably has really low con so let me I don't think so the guards have plus one so number one rules are not two
he fails the second one rolls at 12 fields and the ingriganas the half ogre
has a plus oh that's it okay plus 15 I'm just kidding um Heroes have 13 plus he's he saves
okay what's the damage
I see you in shut Zach saying Goose will live forever you know I'm gonna take this as a challenge hey
um that is a 12 both of the guards just like the other
one before suddenly are about to hold on to Goose one minute the next minute they've turned into frozen statues
again I guess because Curry has used all her movement and her last spell just stands there
looking up at the creature just panicked
it's fine he's more scared of you than you are of him hey from the ground [Laughter]
Ollie you're up the only thing remaining on the battlefield is this enormous half ogre magic swirls in the air your spirit
totem has done a lot of work you stand there growling at this thing that's blaring at you you can see the pieces of
meat stuck in its teeth it's armor its big battle ax it is out for blood
I'm going to run in between the legs and attack looking
for the thigh then yeah the artery if possible hell yeah absolutely people
that are like AJ can think that don't call me out like that
that's a lot okay I'm just thinking of the artery a big thick artery he's got throbbing
artery that's down there yes [Laughter]
if you missed it we're meeting penis that's what that's what we're trying to say it's just intimidating that it's
penis maybe he just has he's a fan of reptiles I was trying to be tactful maybe he's a
Kendall maybe maybe he has a clock you know we could sit here all day
yeah uh this is a bite right yeah so it's 2d6
what do we roll to know what genitals it has nature check I just said that I went for
the jumps I was trying to be tactful but it's a 2d thing you went for this yeah 26 please yeah
it should have just said that I went for it was that how you phrased it you went for the jugs it's 26 plus two sorry yeah
oh plus two so ten ten point ouch um it's going to use has it gone since
no it hasn't so yes it has uh it gets to use its reaction again so 10 reduced by
two takes eight points of damage yikes he's looking really bad uh one might say
that he might be a little bit bloodied even for those of us who played fourth edition okay [Music]
anything else you want to do is you you're do you want to I'll give you this option if you want uh uh Ollie you can latch onto his leg
which would give him disadvantage on his next attack against anybody else but you yeah I'm watching okay as your locks
Ollie I swear God has your jaw locks in like a pit bull it's gonna have to
either smack you or shove a finger up your bum hole to let you go but right now you're just kind of wow that's
actually true actual truth if a pit bull locks a jaw on you uh they teach you
this like when I used to take my dog like if you ever attacked by certain breeds and he's attacked by another dog uh okay so this is this is
I've heard this as well and it's actually not true people's don't get lockjaw that's not a
thing that's a thing it's not it's I I said the same thing and my partner was
like No And she went to uh she did uh biomed so nah I trust some random guy
that taught me it's enough of a common misconception
that it hasn't stopped me dressing up as a pitbull and biting people you know we all have our own uh own
Kinks uh all right you're locked in Goose you're up
Goose gooses that's you yeah it's you and then Linden's next uh goose is gonna use half his movement
to stand up uh classic uh he is going to ready he is
can I I so I've got the I've got the Warhammer and I've got the shield I realize a shield usually is an action
stick is there some way I can just like uh as an object interaction like just like break it off me so that it's just
it's falling to the ground and it's and it's off me you wanna sorry one more time you want to do what just like uh
usually taking off a shield is like a full action I just want to kind of like no you could you could drop it for free
a free action yeah I don't I just as he gets up he just leaves everything there picks up and like draws the head like
the mall uh the heavy mole from his back um and uh
uh yeah he's gonna he's gonna take a swing all right I want you to know by
the way that I quickly Google this thing and you're right there's no lockjaw and I'm very sad about the whole thing so I've been shoving fingers up buttholes
for no reason okay Goose nothing nothing for no reason I mean you know all right
Goose you have the warm all and you are technically flanking with your brother
so you have Advantage gets up and he's like gets up and he's like he's just like shaking his head at this Screech
and he's like wait he's like your mother would be so disappointed um
that is a 18 to hit 18 hits uh you see uh that kind of wind whips
around uh the hammer again and he's gonna hit with thunderous
uh damage booming blade
10 points of bludgeoning damage and I'm gonna push him he is pushed five feet away okay it should be his larger not
huge he is large yeah cool uh as you push him five feet away you said yeah
okay have you guys just done the schoolyard bully thing of like somebody
yeah yeah that's basically a tabletop that's amazing you watch as he holds onto his head there's a dent uh where
you hit him with a hammer uh in his skull and there's just like you can see through the thick skull is that brain
matter oh yeah it is this guy's looking like a dog's breakfast at this point he's still holding up through sheer half
ogre of stubbornness but he is on death's door I'm like I think I made you prettier mate so don't be mad at me
I can't feel oh you can
[Music] I love money all right uh he's starting to become I
heard mummy mummy the first time that's fine he is starting to kind of lose his mind
because he is at death store anything else can show you moving it anymore you're staying still uh I'm staying five
feet away from me and I and I'm attempting very much to get him to uh come towards me all right Lyndon you're
up uh let's see if we can finish this guy then one two punch uh Linden working
with Corey same sort of sim mind going she runs forward and does cold Lyndon is going to try and put a system into shock
by sudden temperature change uh London's going to run up to within range and then cast the create bonfire right beneath
him I think London as as he's running sees there's a goose pushing back and so he sees where he's coming he cast he
casts it right behind him so that as he's stumbling back from Goose right into my fire nice I need to make a
dexterity saving throw yeah I said fire hopefully the sudden cold
from Corey's spell uh changed into the southern heat from mine
what's the DC dc13 uh without even looking at the die
I know I roll the natural way that's a five uh okay so that's a failure
he is going to take six points of fire damage and with this as the gorgonis
gets knocked in the head shot bitten it's a nightmare of a situation he
thought he could just take on the world we're gonna start instead as he stumbles back trips backwards over the tail of
the wolf falls into the pile of this enormous bonfire the strength begins to fail his body as
he cooks living for the next few seconds until finally
Lyndon how would you like to finish him I think
um Hank Linden keeps the fire going as he's as it's flaming up his body is he
wearing like we see in the mini is he got like um High Dameron he's got he's got hide armor he's got like this long fur behind
him of some beer is kind of reminiscent of where he was caught holding onto the poison before just like manipulates the
fire a bit and brings it up the back of him to the first and he can smell you that that burning hair smell that you
all know uh we can hear that we can smell a lot from the The Furs on his back and then it sort of it gets up and
we can smell that sort of cooked pork kind of thing of the the leather and the skins of the hives he's wearing sort of
melting itself yeah you know how it's a spontaneous combustion in IRL is like
when some something catches a light in somebody and then basically people with a lot of uh fat on their body the fat
can start to liquidize and essentially act like the candle wax of a candle and then it just burns a person from the
inside out uh you know how you start that you put your finger up their bum and then it's yeah if you ever catch a
light at least you die happy [Laughter]
um so so uh London keeps the fire going up his back until until he can feel the um
the the ogre the half ogres uh flesh is melting itself and then and then you can
let go of the fire and it just keeps itself burning at that point with this as the ogre liquefies and very
little is left other than bones half melted fat and muscle he's very quickly
unrecognizable and as the sound the only sound that you hear beyond the wind howling through the
winds for just that split moment of a heartbeat is just the heart the sound of the pumping blood in your ears this
it feels like almost an out of body experience as you're feeling you're heart rushing you're the sound of
your breath and you come to as the that tinnitus sort of you just coalesces into one
you're back in the moment and you can hear the footfalls the heavy footfall is running behind you of becklin of Kajol
charging up with a number of pearly burlier villagers that were sitting in the spectator spot
and as they come up the side of the Hill what in the hell
happened here just in time ah great you got here just in time to clean everything up that's
fantastic Corey is immediately running into
Linda's arms and shaking like yeah yeah not doing okay are you okay are you okay
just gonna hold the back of the head and just kind of hold just close and use it comforting you as much as they're
comforting themselves just by like I don't know what we've gotten into with a few days ago we were at wizard school
and and now we're killing monsters this is like uh this is like uh first just
going out to the workforce [Laughter] as you guys are sitting here sort of
dealing with the aftermath of the battle the at that moment coming up the hill
you see walking or on the horse your dad's showing up a little bit later
he slept in because he's not used to drinking so much anymore uh and you can hear him calling out
did I miss anything have we started yet and I wrapped up pretty Nate as I drop
out of the trace oh oh yeah yeah oh that must have been
that must have hurt really bad oh he's gonna run up and just start sniffing this the spear wound
ah yeah no like you're actually uh um that's where it go that's yeah that's
the that's the spirit I'm assuming I always say always say never get stabbed by a spear
Endeavor to do that next time good um uh he walks up to Juniper and he's
like Jin uh on three okay one just and then he put the thing
out as you
as you pull it out you can punch me if you want that's fine I need you to make a medicine check please
good [Music]
you've killed me my last words I haunt you uh as you pull
the spear out uh uh Judy you suffer two points of damage right uh this thing was partially Barbed
and he rips some muscle and sinew out and doing so it hurts there's blood that's seeping out of it
um you're you're familiar enough with dressing wounds uh from you know either your fights after every you know brawl
that you've had or any show that you've put on uh that she's not gonna bleed out but certainly that was not the cleverest
idea you've ever had that was that was in there yeah that was
that was deep in there I should have probably not done that one uh it's done now goose is gonna like rip
a strip off his shirt and then like like Pat it up and it's like this no all
right it needs clean clean bandages
you know what just um if someone completely in the direction of a tent
I'll do it myself you watch beside you he's going to yeah go ahead
push the nozzle underneath Junie D to help her walk in a direction or to have
her ride uh Ollie people are backing away from you the villagers that came up to help you watch
as becklin takes a step back I've speckling could you be useful for a
second and step forward and get some kind of medical help maybe as she's
looking she says you know what yes and as she turns to see the dwarf there the leader of the Merc
Camp she pulls out from behind her manacles and you watch as she shackles the dwarf
until we get answers we're all going back to town kajal I'm sorry but I don't know what to
think right now we need to get to the bottom of this and I don't know who I can trust quite yet you lot with me
ah who is healthy enough to look she starts delegating some of the villagers to look after the people were injured across the battlefield
it is a battlefield and it is littered with what should have been a Happy Day's
commemoration and reenactment that has happened hundreds of times now a fun day for kids and adults alike to
remember the Lolo moans of the dying The Silence of the Dead is heavy on the
battlefields ulot have done your part and she asks you to please take kajal back with you
back to town while she and the rest of them collect what they can and start
bringing people home before they deal with the corpses at a later time
it goes very somber the walk back to wagler
is quiet and eventually you do arrive to town with your father beside you
walking with Judy the horse and as you arrive back to town I think
that's where we'll end it for today and we'll pick up the pieces next week to figure out what exactly happened at the
Battle of high hill cool that was fun
well done you guys that's good um oh God as you guys get back we're
gonna do this here you do if you could hear it in your mind's eye Bing you do level up to three
[Music] so last time we did this we decided if
we wanted to roll the hit points or not and we could do that again so uh let's uh and you don't all have to do the same
I don't mind but if you want to roll hit points you can if you want to take the average you can I'm gonna put somebody on the spot right away we're gonna put
the the two people together out in uh that corner of the world dread and what
will you choose to do I'm in a brawl okay uh for some reason I'm having a
mind blank on what hit dice I need there sir yeah yeah
a Motorola d a
eight nice that's huge what does that put your hip points at you and you add the modifier
17 sir it'll be 25 plus con mode which is plus two for you if a coin of 14. yes
so you're at 27 27 hit points is respectable for level three
nice all right the twins will be for Less because it's always the most ridiculous
um Juniper Rose what will you choose do you want to take average or do you want to roll your hit points I would like to
roll mine please get reminder chat I am heartless I'm a big jerk if they roll a one they're just stuck with one so roll
your uh you get a d10 I think T10 yeah 10 for ranges
uh so that it I rolled A4 okay plus your con modified
it's just a smidge under average but it's not bad Goose Stars respectable
last time I rolled then I rolled uh worse than the average yeah so statistically
yeah that's how stats work exactly as a player try not to roll okay
I got straight on the average okay uh four uh four is below average for you right
all right I was just gonna say there was almost wait D6 oh okay I see I see I see what's
happening here um I see what's happening here all right exactly
last time I think Linden rolled for the twins correct so Corey do you choose to
I think you guys Are Gonna Roll right yeah okay
that is it two yeah twins
do I get to roll last time yeah I'm Gonna Roll a die too because my bad
guys leveled up too all right perfect yay a hundred
um so cool now our now our total hit points is 16 at level three we're gonna
make it you guys squishy Wizards hey nothing but up right
